# AAAI 2026: 3D Semantic Segmentation with Knowledge Distillation for Dynamic-Size Feature Maps

### Abstract

This paper presents a plug-in framework for improving LiDAR-based 3D semantic segmentation. By aggregating multiple frames, we reconstruct denser and more complete point clouds, which act as supervision for a knowledge distil- lation process invariant to feature-map dimensionality. The student model thus benefits from enriched representations while maintaining standard single-frame inference. On the large-scale Waymo Open Dataset, our approach improves segmentation performance by 0.5â€“3% in mIoU and 0.4-1.1% in overall accuracy (allAcc) compared to the baseline student model, demonstrating consistent gains on challenging out- door scenes.
